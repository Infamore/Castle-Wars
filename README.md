***Objective***

A minigame that assigns attributes to each class object that represents a CPU or NPC that are denoted as ```Wizard```, ```Knight```, ```Novice```. The goal is to defend the castle from a boss that begins the journey from a thousand miles away. Each turn the user has an option from the menu to either train, heal, list members, stall for a round, enter the final stage, or quit the game. However, after the round the boss gets closer to the castle. Once the boss reaches the destination the final stage begins. The NPC/CPU gains levels by earning experience points through battling random instances that updates the total amount of experience points. In the final form the user continues to the last stage where all developed NPC's or CPU's participate in battle with the final boss.
